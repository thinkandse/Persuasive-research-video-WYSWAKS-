Title to be decided but I am thinking it should be:

Why you should watch a Kids show


Script and plan:
[Start off with clips of cartoons, Unicorn Academy, PJ Masks, Paw patrol, My little pony, Anything else that you like!]

[Keep playing it in the background but mute it]

When you saw that clip, what did you think? Nostalgic? Heartfelt? Happy?
I actually bet that 90% of you did NOT say anything like that, most people probably have gotten bored, or ‘cringed’ at the clip. Now, I am assuming that you all, are between 13 and 18, teenagers, but this video will still be informative to people outside of this age range, talking to you adults and kids here!
This video will be structured like a research article or paper, with a rationale, research question, analysis, and conclusion. Reference list in the description, along with all the shows, music, etc.
And by the way, a research paper is basically what a professional writes in order to prove a hypothesis, obviously I am no professional, but I did do some research. Most of you probably have or will do a research paper as an assignment/assessment in science in at least year 8.

Anyways, without further ado, let’s get started!

[Introduction, a title of Why you should watch a Kids show]

I’ve recently watched a TV show, or cartoon, on Netflix. It’s called Unicorn Academy, and I think, it’s ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I first watched the first season near late November, about nearly a month after it was first released and aired on Netflix, found it on my starting recommendations, lucky me I guess.
