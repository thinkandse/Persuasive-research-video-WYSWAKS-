Title to be decided but I am thinking it should be:

Why you should watch a Kids show


Script and plan:
[Start off with clips of cartoons, Unicorn Academy, PJ Masks, Paw patrol, My little pony, Anything else that you like!]

[Keep playing it in the background but mute it]

When you saw that clip, what did you think? Nostalgic? Heartfelt? Happy?
I actually bet that 90% of you did NOT say anything like that, most people probably have gotten bored, or ‘cringed’ at the clip. Now, I am assuming that you all, are between 13 and 18, teenagers, but this video will still be informative to people outside of this age range, talking to you adults and kids here!
This video will be structured like a research article or paper, with a rationale, research question, analysis, and conclusion. Reference list in the description, along with all the shows, music, etc.
And by the way, a research paper is basically what a professional writes in order to prove a hypothesis, obviously I am no professional, but I did do some research. Most of you probably have or will do a research paper as an assignment/assessment in science in at least year 8.

Anyways, without further ado, let’s get started!

[Introduction, a title of Why you should watch a Kids show]

I’ve recently watched a TV show, or cartoon, on Netflix. It’s called Unicorn Academy, and I think, it’s ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I first watched the first season near late November, about nearly a month after it was first released and aired on Netflix, found it on my starting recommendations, lucky me I guess.

This has inspired me to make this video, I really think that more teenagers these days could use a bit of cartoons, but I will go over this in a little more detail soon, after the reasoning, but we need to get onto the “rationale” of this video.

Why am I making this video? I will explain this in more detail at the conclusion actually, this is typically terrible in a research paper to do, but this is a video, I think I want to say this to the people who actually watch the video, so stay tuned for it! But in a broad explanation, I think more teenagers, and possibly adults, should watch cartoons and kids shows, I did say Unicorn Academy Inspired this video, which is completely true, I loved that show and its message, I really recommend you to watch that show; if you don’t know what show to watch, more recommendations in the conclusion as well! 
Most of us as kids, I would say, have watched at least 1 cartoon, I still remember the good old days where I loved ABC kids, then I started watching ABC Me, those are channels in my TV, I haven’t watched live TV in so long! I kind of want to watch some now. Those days were nostalgic, I loved watching shows like Twirlywoos, classic, and PJ Masks, watching cartoons actually taught me English!

It looks like that cartoons have many benefits, which I certainly think it does, but to find that out, we need to ask the following Research Question:

Research Question: How does the power of cartoons improve general things in teenagers, kids, and adults?!

Analysis: Now this part is the analysis, but instead of a traditional analysis (since this is a video, of course), I will name features and main benefits of the cartoons, along with evidence!

1.	Relieves stress
Now, this point basically means that cartoons let you “escape”, like escape a harsh reality. But keep in mind, it isn’t necessarily bad to escape once in a while, like once a day, and cartoons are a good way to escape, don’t be the type of person that uses things like vapes and stuff to escape, that’s just bad.

When I watched Unicorn Academy, I cried many times, most noticeably at the end of season/chapter 2, it was so amazing! Honestly, these positive messages that Unicorn Academy has really shows teenagers these days what being a good person is all about, kindness, friendship, love, common themes of cartoons these days and back in the day.

Cartoons are great at making us feel less lonely and makes us smile [gentle tone here]. Laughter has so many benefits, same with just smiling, these include stimulating organs, activating and relieving the stress response of the body, soothes tension, improves our immune system, relieves pain, increases personal satisfaction, and lastly but not leastly, improves out mood!

2.	Emotional Resonance and Empathy.
One of the most significant parts of animation is the fact that it can control our emotions. As the viewers, we often experience a range of emotions throughout the show, that the writers and animators wanted. Cartoon characters are often faced with various challenges, triumphs, and setbacks. The way the characters, well… Mostly the protagonist, but also many side characters, walk through their amazing story leaves us with many emotions. But what does this mean for us the viewer you may ask? Well, researchers have actually found out that certain regions in the brain responsible for having empathy, such as the anterior insula and mirror neurons, are activated when we watch characters in cartoons express certain emotions. This leads to an “emotional resonance” where we are able to feel joy, sadness, fear, or excitement with the characters, probably many more emotions too! This emotional bond strengthens our connection to the story, emotionally, leading to a more memorable and immersive story. Now, I am assuming that these emotions (that are good of course), carry on outside of the cartoon

 


3.	Nostalgia…
I’m sure that we’ve all seen a good cartoon before in our lives, especially in our childhoods, again, for me, I really like cartoons and I will name a few. I grew up as a little kid watching “Bonnie Bears”, this is really popular in the area where I live in, I feel nostalgic from it! Next on the list is the entire ABC Kids channel, and all past shows basically, I watched channel 22 as a kid in Australia, my dad said that channels 22 and 23 had great kids shows! I enjoyed many shows for kids like Twirlywoos, my personal favourite, story time, I didn’t really like Play School, but I find it nostalgic now, I then loved PJ Masks, another personal favourite now, and nostalgic! I can name so many shows, Octonauts, Hey Duggee, Peppa Pig, Ben and Holly’s little Kingdom, Shaun the Sheep, so many! I do remember going to this ABC Kids convention as a kid in year 3 I think, where I saw the main host, I think that’s his role, Jimmy Giggle, I remember how I was one of the OLDEST ones there! Yeah, a year 3 being one of the oldest kids at the ABC Kids convention. I then went and grew up to like year 3 and 4 and started watching ABC ME more, a TV channel for more of an older audience, older kids and early teenagers. I loved many shows there too, like Slugterra, pretty sure that stopped development which is pretty sad, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was also a good one, but I really liked Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir, I know a lot of you know this one, these 2 superheros, I think this is one of the only shows back in the day in which I still watch now, today! Now as of today, I like many kids Cartoons, like Miraculous, Unicorn Academy, as of now it’s my personal favourite! Watch it! My little Pony, I remember watching a bit of this as a pre-schooler and Kindergartener, but now I am rewatching it, and Monster High!

Now, you just heard me yap a crazy amount of good TV shows, I would actually like to hear you guys yap too in the comments, since this will be my first “Official Video” on Youtube, I can probably respond to many comments! I don’t think there will be many people watching this video, but like, it doesn’t matter much, I am happy to hear your guys’ opinions on kids TV’s that make you nostalgic, happy, and entertained, maybe this video will inspire you to watch a kids show, hopefully it does! That’s my goal! This section really made me nostalgic, you should find some shows that make you nostalgic too!
