# Why-you-should-watch-a-Kids-show (persuasive research video for Youtube)
This is for YouTube Video, my first ever! This will be made in premiere pro with thumbnail still being decided. WYSWAKS stands for Why you should watch a kids show. Final Script (with all changes in each hour) is the file that has the final script and is updated every hour, Hour _ progress is where I am up to in the script after each hour, final script lets you see changes if you see history.

<h3>Started working on the thumbnail, found 2 images and put them in photoshop, had to add blur to the background of 1 image and them made the middle look more clean, started on colour correction but not yet finished.</h3>
<h1>Hour 9:</h1>
<br>
<h3>Long hour. But I added a glow effect around 3 subjects, the fate fairy, protagonist on the left, and 1 ofther subject on the right, continuing adding glow effect next few hours!</h3>
<h1>Hour 10:</h1>
<br>
<h3>Made glow for all subjects, added colour correction, text needed lastly!</h3>

<br>
<h3>This thumbnail added text and fixed colour correction, old one was too saturated, and has too many purple hues, orange hues became lighter and red hues also became lighter, those were the complexion/skin colour of some characters and they were too saturated! Video Editing is ready now!</h3>

<br>
<h3>This hour I fixed an annoying download issue with 4K Video Downloader+, it took me a few steps before deciding to reinstall it, then I found clips of cartoons and downloaded them, basically ready for editing now! </h3>
